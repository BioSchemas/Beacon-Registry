# Welcome to Beacon - Registry

This is a Proof of Concept to show how [Beacon's Web Pages] (https://beacon-network.org/#/), can be enriched by [DataCatalog schema] (http://schema.org/DataCatalog) and made it easy to mantain an updated registry of existing beacons and it's datasets.

## Requirements

1. Homebrew installed. [Installation] (https://brew.sh/)
2. Python 3 with virtual environment installed. [Installation] (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-macos)
3. Install Extruct. [Installation] (https://github.com/scrapinghub/extruct)
4. Install a Web Server as [XAMPP] (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to host modified beacon's pages.
